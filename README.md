# TOP-Calculator

## Assignment Outline
This assignment is the final assignment for the Foundations course, using all knowledge in the prevous lesson I need to create a calculator from the bottom up. This calculator must have a interactable UI that will be used to provide the inputs needed for the calculator to work. The main goal is to build the calculator using knowledge gained throughout the Foundations course and additional research (google, test, fail!, google, test, works!, repeat).

##Personal Note
Whilst I have not been able to consistently work on this assignment due to time real-life (Kinda sucks) I have been pleased to apply my knowledge and work through a tough task such as this, this has really applied my knowledge and skills into completing this assignment, whilst there is still some ground to cover and knowledge to gain this has been really intresting and kinda fun but also frustrating.
