# TOP-Calculator

## Assignment Outline
This assignment is the final assignment for the Foundations course, using all knowledge in the prevous lesson I need to create a calculator from the bottom up. This calculator must have a interactable UI that will be used to provide the inputs needed for the calculator to work. The main goal is to build the calculator using knowledge gained throughout the Foundations course and additional research (google, test, fail!, google, test, works! repeat).

## Personal Note
Whilst I have not been able to consistently work on this assignment due to time real-life (Kinda sucks) I have been pleased to apply my knowledge and work through a tough task such as this, this has really applied my knowledge and skills into completing this assignment, whilst there is still some ground to cover and knowledge to gain this has been really intresting and kinda fun but also frustrating.

Reworked the calculator.js in a new file (Calculator2.js) as was not happy with formating and code layout. Rewrote the code and improved areas where it was needed, also sectioned areas using comments to help with readability. Whilst still a work in progress was able to reach end stages of the assignment. Due to rework of the code was able to remove a couple of bugs that I was encountering.

After many hours of researching, testing and fixing the calculator is finally compelte all requirements + additonal brownie points met. Decided to leave first calculator file on to see the difference in the two. While the keyboard support is functional it is bloated I hope to in the future return with greater knowledge to neaten and debloat this, a side note to try reduce the repeative code should of created functions that the listeners will call when activated. Enjoy this okay-ish calculator
